      Mathematics is an area of knowledge that
      includes the topics of numbers, formulas
      and related structures, shapes and the spaces
      in which they are contained, and quantities
      and their changes. These topics are represented
      in modern mathematics with the major subdisciplines
      of number theory algebra geometry and
      analysis respectively. There is no general
      consensus among mathematicians about a
      common definition for their academic discipline.

      Most mathematical activity involves the
      discovery of properties of abstract objects
      and the use of pure reason to prove them.
      These objects consist of either
      abstractions from nature or—in modern
      mathematics—entities that are stipulated to
      have certain properties, called axioms. A proof consists of a
      succession of applications of deductive rules
      to already established results. These results
      include previously proved theorems, axioms,
      and—in case of abstraction from nature—some basic properties that are
      considered true starting points of the theory under consideration
